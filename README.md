# Rosemary
A revision of the screenplay for Rosemary's Baby if Valerie Solanas' SCUM Manifesto had prompted rapid and complete societal change decades earlier.  This project is the final project for the Harvard course GENED 1130: Black Power, Radical Feminism, and Gay Liberation. 
This work adapts and uses plot, characters, formatting, and some verbiage from the original screenplay by Roman Polanski, based on the novel by Ira Levin. This falls under Fair Use as a noncommercial parody work.
